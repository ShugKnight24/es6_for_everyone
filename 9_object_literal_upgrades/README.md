# Object Literal Upgrades

## Lesson 1 - Object Literal Upgrades

- This was a fairly simple a straightforward lesson on a few Object literal improvements.

  - I like that you don't have to reuse the key / value pair if the key has the same name as the variable used to reset it

    - You can also change the key name if you so choose

  - I don't often place methods within objects (something I do need to get better at), but I did like this shortcut

  - The computed property names was pretty nifty

    - I've really come to like template literals

	  - They make writing strings and HTML with variables a lot simpler

  - Using shift() (and I'm assuming other Array methods) to set key value pairs of an object

    - Really cool technique

## Final Thoughts

- I'm really starting to enjoy the new features being implemented into ES6

  - I'm seeing the techniques as giving the developer the ability to write less code and making the code that is written easier to read
