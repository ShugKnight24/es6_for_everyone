# An Array of Array Improvements

## Lesson 1 - Spread Operator Introduction

- The spread operator is something I'm somewhat familiar with due to going through a handful of React tutorials

  - It is really useful, and something that I hope to continue to integrate into my own code

## Lesson 2 - Spread Exercise

- This was a fun lesson

  - I was really happy that Wes gave instructions prior to going into the solution so I could attempt it

  - I was able to solve the problem, but I got to the solution in a somewhat roundabout manner

  - Seeing his solution was pretty crazy. It was really clean and really concise. I want to get to point where I can write that type of code.

    - It just seemed to make sense once I saw his approach, but there are different manners in solving a problem.

	- I am excited to continue learning so I can continue to improve my skills

## Lesson 3 - More Spread Examples

- It was nice seeing more examples of how to use the spread operator effectively

  - I'm really enjoying going through these videos because the concepts that Wes teaches you build off of each other

    - I enjoy knowing how to solve some of the problems he discusses with techniques he taught in earlier lessons

- Wes also mentioned something in the closing seconds of the video that was pretty important

  - You can use the spread operator in React without mutating the state

## Lesson 4 - Spreading into a Function

- This was actually a really nifty lesson

  - I can see how the use of the spread operator in these instances would make your could much more readable and easier to understand

## Lesson 5 - The ...rest param in Functions and Destructuring

- `...rest` is really cool, especially in the context that was illustrated.

  - You can set default params and then any additional values that may be passed it will be pushed into one array due to the rest operator

  - The second portion was a review of destructuring examples we saw in a past video, but it was still a nice refresher

## Final Thoughts

- I'm really enjoying going through this course and learning as much ES6 as possible.

  - Now, I just really want to start implementing as much as I possibly clean

  - As I mention above, it has been nice seeing old techniques being used and me being confident in being able to solve them before Wes says the answer

  - I still recognize that I have a long way to go

    - Going over the spread exercise, I was ultimately able to get a working solution, but Wes' solution was incredibly elegant compared to my own.

	  - This is not something I am too worried about. This increased and improved approach to programmatic thinking will come with time and more practice.

	  - I'm excited to keep learning and growing as a developer.
