# Template Strings

## Lesson 1 - Template Strings Introductions

- Fairly simple lesson, but very helpful

- I've been slowly trying to use ES6 at work, and while we won't be using it on any of our client facing code, template literals are something that can significantly help me to improve the readibility of certain sections of my code.

- Especially the portion that looks like it will be discussed in the following lesson of creating HTML fragments in your JavaScript.

## Lesson 2 - Creating HTML fragments with Template Literals

### Part 1

- I am so happy to have discovered template strings! I'm really looking forward to going back and refactoring some old code I wrote that was pretty hard to read.

### Part 2

- The second part that illustrates the ability to loop over template strings by returning markup within ` `` ` is pretty incredible.

  - This will make my life easier when generating dynamic content from arrays.

### Part 3

- I really love the fact that you can use ternaries within template Strings

  - That added level of control with conditional statements will give me a lot of power when creating HTML in JavaScript.

### Part 4

- I found it really cool that you can call functions within a template tag.

  - I can see how using that technique would prove tremendously useful and make your code much more readable. This is something I really want to play with.

## Lesson 3 - Tagged Template Literals

- This was a pretty awesome Lesson

  - I really liked seeing how a template string could be tagged with a particular functions

  - As I said in the comments, I'm not sure where this would prove useful, but I'm sure there are plenty of scenarios.

    - The fact that what you pass in can be manipulated how you want is pretty awesome in and of itself.

## Lesson 4 - Tagged Templates Exercise

- Well I guess this lesson illustrated the type of scenarios where tagged templates could prove to be highly beneficial.

  - You have a decent dataset and you want to manipulate it in a particular manner

- One thing I didn't like is that I assumed Wes was going to lay out the problem, and give the user the opportunity to solve it independently.

  - He may have done this, but if that were the case, I missed it. I should have figured what the challenge was and attempted to solve it myself before continuing with the video.

- Tagged templates seem pretty useful. I would like to get more practice with them to get a better hold of when they should be used.

## Lesson 5 - Sanitizing User Data with Tagged Templates

- Security is something that really fascinates me but a field that I don't have nearly enough information about.

  - As I said in the comments for this lesson, I would like to learn as much as possible about potential threats so that I can write code that is optimized to prevent anything malicious from occurring.

- Definitely something I want to dive deeper into in the future.
