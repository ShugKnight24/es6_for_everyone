# An Array of Array Improvements

## Lesson 1 - Array.from() and Array.of()

- Really enjoyed going over these new methods that can be used on Arrays

  - I've already used `Array.from()` in the past, and found it really useful when working with NodeLists

  - I'm not too sure how often I'll use `Array.of()`, but I'm sure there will be scenarios when it will prove beneficial

## Lesson 2 - Array.find() and .findIndex()

- I can really see `.find()` being extremely useful

  - Typically, I will have a huge dataset, and I'm looking for a particular item within that array

- I can also see scenarios where `findIndex()` would be beneficial

  - There are times where I know what I have, but want to find it's position to update the dataset

    - Typically, this will occur more often with objects, so I hope there is a similar method that can be used on them

## Lesson 3 - Array.some() and .every()

- I don't really know when I would use `.some()` or `.every()`

  - The examples Wes used made sense, but I'm not sure I'll encounter data like that.

    - These kinds of methods may be more powerful when chained with others

    - On second thought, the condition is really the important part.

      - I think I actually could make use of these methods depending on what I check.

As always, I want to play around with all of these further so that I can get a better sense of when to use these methods and how to use them most effectively.
