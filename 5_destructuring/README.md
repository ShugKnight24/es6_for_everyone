# Destructuring

## Lesson 1 - Destructuring Objects

- I found this lecture pretty fascinating

  - Pulling out variables from objects is something I do somewhat regularly

    - I can see how it would be beneficial to pull out a property from an object and assign that value to a variable

      - I suppose this is just a matter of writing slightly less (tedious) code

      - The ability to rename the variables is also pretty neat

  - I can also see why setting default values would be extremely beneficial

  - The whole concept around destructuring is pretty fascinating to me, but I don't think I quite grasp it all too well.

    - With any new thing I learn, it is a master of getting some experience with the concept to better understand it.

      - I'll need to play around with it a bit to get more comfortable

## Lesson 2 - Destructuring Arrays

- I work pretty heavily with arrays at work, so I can definitely see the benefit of destructuring of Arrays

  - One thing I especially liked was the ... rest operator that allows you to pull the values you want and set the rest into a different array.

## Lesson 3 - Swapping Variables with Destructuring

- It is pretty cool how quickly and easily you can swap the values of different variables without going through the hassle of having to create a temp variable.

## Lesson 4 - Destructuring Functions - Multiple Returns and Named Defaults

- This was a neat Lesson

  - I really enjoyed seeing how you could destructure values from a function into an objects

  - I also found it pretty cool that you could destructure the parameters of a function so that the order they are passed in is irrelevant.

  - Even cooler, you can set the entire functions parameters to default values and set them to an object and call the function without passing any arguments and still return all of the default values. Really cool stuff

In general, I found the destructuring section really fascinating. I'll have to put these lessons into practice so I can fully grasp the different techniques and how I can optimally use them.

  - They seem somewhat bizarre at first, as many of these ES6 concepts do to someone who is being introduced to them for the first time, but I can really see how a lot of the techniques can make my life easier, not to mention the people who know their way around JavaScript even more throughly.
