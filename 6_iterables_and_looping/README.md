# Iterables and Looping

## Lesson 1 - The For of Loop

- I've never heard of a for of loop so it was cool being introduced to it

  - It was also nice having a brief refresher of the other for loops in JavaScript

  - I knew you could use `break`, but I didn't know that you could use `continue` within for loops

    - I had an instance where knowing this would have been useful at my job this previous week.

    - I can now go and refactor that code! =]

## Lesson 2 - The For of Loop in Action

- I really enjoyed this lesson as it brought a lot of clarity on instances where using a for of loop would be beneficial

- Also, Wes using generators was really cool and I'm excited to eventually get to the point of understanding those concepts

- The for of example in the function was really cool because you don't have to necessarily account for every possible argument that will be passed into a function.

  - You can use for of to iterate through what is passed in

## Lesson 3 - Using for of with Objects

- It was interesting seeing that a for of loop could not be used with an Object

  - There were a few workarounds like `Object.keys()`

  - In the future, `obj.entries()`

- Wes recommends using a for in loop

I want to practice the for of loop more so that I can use it properly. It is really fascinating being exposed to all of these new techniques. It kind of blows my mind that there is so much out there. I really enjoy learning all of these methods and will use my newly gained knowledge to continue to improve my skills as a developer.
