# ES6 for Everyone Progress

**Note**: I will be using this repo to track my progress with Wes Bos' course, [ES6 For Everyone](https://es6.io/). I've really enjoyed Wes' JavaScript 30 course and I've been wanting to dive into ES6 for a long time now. I've learned bits and pieces from other tutorials I've taken, but I've never really sat down to cover all of the new ES6 features. This repo will help me create some personal accountability and start tracking my growth as a JavaScript developer as I make my way through this course. I hope to improve my skills with ES6, and improve my general approach to programmatic thinking by completing this course.

I will update this README as I complete the different lessons within the course.
