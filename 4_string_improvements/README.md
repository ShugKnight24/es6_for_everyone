# Additional String Improvements

## Lesson 1 - New String Methods

- These are some really cool new methods

  - I can really see myself using `includes()` a ton to check if a certain string contains a specific value.

  - I can see both `startsWith()` and `endsWith()` being extremely useful for manipulating data that follows a similar pattern.

  - I'm not to sure where I would use `repeat()`, but I'm sure there is a place I could use it.
